Our group had to turn to grey literature and internet browsing as a solution.\n","\n","We discovered [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) - an opensource emebdding database that can serves as a LLM knowledge base for prompting. This database allowed us to store our code in the database, and perform semantic search with app reviews. We performed three different methods of source code localization, and presented this final method as the one achieving the best result.\n","\n","## Approach 1\n","The first approach is to simply extract all Java code, and use a code model to convert the code files into embeddings. After the embeddings have been stored in the database, use semantic search to perform searches and compare the result file with the correct file.\n","\n","The result: `Precision: 8.2%, Recall: 16.4%, F1: 10.9%`\n","\n","The issues with this approach and why it did not perform well:\n","\n","- Some Java files contain more tokens than the model could handle, so the resulting embeddings did not represent the full code\n","- The code model provided embedding specifically trained for code. When it is applied to natural language, it may fall short, and vice versa. In this scenario, a bimodal language model adept at extracting features from both natural language and code is better, like [CodeT5+](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codet5p-220m-bimodal). Unfortunately this model is currently not supported by txtai\n","\n","## Approach 2\n","The second approach is to first summarize each method of each Java class using a code model trained to perform documentation generation of Java code, [CodeTrans](https://huggingface.co/SEBIS/code_trans_t5_base_code_documentation_generation_java). The summarization of each file is then stored in the embedding database. Then the semantic search is performed, and the results are compared.\n","\n","The summarization process can be seen in [this Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SDR5iKsyAeV6f43fQExWcPJfyhyGkwTp?usp=drive_link)\n","\n","The result is round F1 20% depending on how many predicted search results are taken.\n","\n","The issues with this approach and why it did not perform well:\n","- The summarization performed a layer of abstraction, and important features may be lost in the process.\n","- Despite summarization, some input could still be too long to process by the code model.\n","\n","## Final Approach\n","The chosen approach with the best result is presented in this Collab. Each method of each Java file is collected and stored in the embedding database. When a method belonging to a file gets retrieved by the database, we record the file path and compare it to the correct file.\n","This approach achieved the best result: `Precision: 42.2%, Recall: 74.4%, F1: 53.9%`"],"metadata":{"id":"ljBNCl94uis1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 1: Access Data\n","Mount the drive: The data is stored in Google
